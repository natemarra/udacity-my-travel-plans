# udacity-my-travel-plans
Part of Udacity Full-Stack Web Developer course on working with Remotes. (GitHub Repository)


#   This is the structure and content after following along with project. It may look a little different from the main course and or other 
#   course students. I believe this may be due to shortening and or rushing through examples on their part. My structure at the time of
#   making this entry on Nov 21, 2017 is a bit different from what the file/ folder structure of what the instructor's looks like on his 
#   youtube video at this point. Refer to my commit at SHA 4c9eb15, vs https://youtu.be/UBYxcTg6VLU.
